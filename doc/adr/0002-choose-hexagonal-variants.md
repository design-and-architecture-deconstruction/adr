# 2. Choose Hexagonal Variants

Date: 2020-03-04

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We would like to deconstruct the various hexagonal architecture variants that have been proposed, separate them from any language or paradigm specific constraints, and reconstruct an opinionated variant that will be used as the basis for coding experiments going forward.

An additional desire is that the style we choose is synergistic with the best in DDD code-level design thinking.

Current list to consider:

* Cockburn's Hexagonal
* Onion Architecture
* Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob)
* Are there otheres?

## Decision

TODO: The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

## Consequences

TODO: What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
